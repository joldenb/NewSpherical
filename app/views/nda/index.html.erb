<!-- <p>This Non-Disclosure Agreement (“Agreement”) is effective immediately and is entered into by and between Planetwork NGO Inc. having an office at 1230 Market Street Suite 517 San Francisco, CA 94102 and the party completing the online signup form at https://topical.planetwork.net.</p>
 
<p>For purposes of this Agreement, the party disclosing the Confidential Information (as that term is defined below) shall be referred to as the “Disclosing Party” and the party receiving the Confidential Information shall be referred to as the “Receiving Party.”</p>
 
<p>The parties agree as follows:</p>
 
<p>1. Definition of Confidential Information – "Confidential Information" means any non-public information and all copies thereof in whatever form or medium that is designated by Disclosing Party as being confidential or which under the circumstances surrounding the disclosure should, in the exercise of reasonable judgment, be recognized by Receiving Party to be confidential. Confidential Information includes: information relating to the Disclosing Party and/or its business including, without limitation, intellectual property; financial statements, information and data, projections and forecasts; business plans, contacts and relationships; marketing plans and strategies; customer, supplier, reseller and partner lists and information; employee lists and information; business methods; product and service plans, prices, pricing models, information and technical specifications and manuals; service specifications; research and development projects; tools; methodologies; know-how; and product source code or object code whether furnished directly or indirectly by a Disclosing Party to a Receiving Party, and whether disclosed in anticipation of this Agreement or after the date of this Agreement.</p>
 
<p>2.  Permitted Use – This Agreement is made in order for each party to obtain from the other certain technical and/or business information for the purpose of establishing a potential business relationship between the parties (“Permitted Use”) under terms that will protect the confidential and proprietary nature of such information.  Confidential Information disclosed under this Agreement may be used by a Receiving Party for the sole purpose of the Permitted Use and shall not be used for any other purpose.</p>
 
<p>3.  Permitted Disclosure/Standard of Care – Receiving Party shall not disclose any of Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information except as specifically provided in this Agreement. Receiving Party shall protect Confidential Information from disclosure with the same degree of care Receiving Party uses to protect its own proprietary information similar in nature, provided such degree of care is at least a reasonable degree of care.  Receiving Party shall not disclose Confidential Information to any person other than directors, officers, employees and consultants of Receiving Party or of its parent companies or affiliates (affiliates being entities under common control and ownership with Receiving Party) who have an absolute need to know the Confidential Information, who are informed by Receiving Party of the confidential nature of the Confidential Information and who are bound by obligations of confidentiality either by written agreement or by professional duty of confidence (“Permitted Persons”).  Receiving Party may make only so many copies of the Confidential Information as is absolutely necessary for the Permitted Use.  In the event Receiving Party becomes aware of any misappropriation or misuse of Confidential Information, Receiving Party shall promptly notify Disclosing Party in writing and assist Disclosing Party in any proceedings related thereto.</p>
 
<p>4. Exceptions to Confidentiality – The obligations of confidentiality shall not apply to any item of Confidential Information to the extent Receiving Party can establish by legally sufficient evidence that such item of Confidential Information:</p>
 
<p>a. is or becomes part of the public domain through no fault or omission of Receiving Party;<br />
b. is disclosed by Disclosing Party to others without restrictions on use and disclosure;<br />
c. becomes known or available to Receiving Party without restriction from a source other than Disclosing Party without breach of agreement by Receiving Party;<br />
d. is disclosed with the prior written approval of Disclosing Party;<br />
e. is independently developed by Receiving Party without the use of any Confidential Information provided by Disclosing Party;<br />
f. is known to Receiving Party on a non-confidential basis prior to disclosure by Disclosing Party to Receiving Party; or,<br />
g. is required by court order or government agency to be disclosed, in which case, Receiving Party shall give Disclosing Party as much notice as is reasonably practical so that Disclosing Party may seek a protective order or other confidential protection as Disclosing Party, in its sole discretion, may elect and Receiving Party shall reasonably cooperate, at Disclosing Party’s expense, with the Disclosing Party in the Disclosing Party’s efforts to obtain such order or protection.</p>
 
<p>The burden of proving that information is not Confidential Information shall be on the party asserting such exclusion.</p>
 
<p>5. Rights of Ownership – All Confidential Information disclosed to Receiving Party pursuant to this Agreement shall be and shall remain the property of Disclosing Party or its licensors.  Receiving Party recognizes and agrees that nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as granting any property rights to Receiving Party, by license or otherwise, to any Confidential Information disclosed pursuant to this Agreement, or to any trade secret, copyright, trademarks or patent, or any other intellectual property right that has issued or that may issue based upon the Confidential Information. </p>        
 
<p>6. Remedies – Each party acknowledges that the other will have no adequate remedy at law if it violates any of the provisions of this Agreement.  Accordingly, each party shall have the right, in addition to any other rights and remedies it may have, at law, in equity or otherwise, to seek in any court of competent jurisdiction injunctive relief to restrain any breach or threatened breach hereof or otherwise to specifically enforce any of the provisions of this Agreement.  Furthermore, in no event shall either party be liable for special, exemplary, incidental, or consequential damages arising from the breach of this Agreement, whether or not the possibility of such damages has been disclosed to the other party in advance or could have been reasonably foreseen by such breaching party.   Should an action be brought, the prevailing party (as determined by the court) shall be entitled to a reasonable sum for attorneys’ fees and costs in addition to any other relief which may be awarded.</p>
 
<p>7. Return of Confidential Information – At the request of Disclosing Party, Receiving Party shall immediately return all copies of the Confidential Information or Receiving Party shall destroy all such copies and provide a written certification from an officer of Receiving Party that all such copies have been destroyed.</p>

<p>8. Disclaimers – Nothing in this Agreement shall obligate either party to disclose any information to the other party or obligate either party to enter into any other agreements.  No representation or warranty of any kind is given by Disclosing Party with respect to the Confidential Information disclosed to Receiving Party including, but not limited to, any representation or warranty as to its accuracy or completeness.  The Disclosing Party shall not have any liability or responsibility for errors or omissions in, or any decisions made by the Receiving Party in reliance on any Confidential Information disclosed under this Agreement.</p>

<p>9. Term and Termination – Either party may terminate this Agreement on thirty days (30) written notice to the other party at the address set forth in this Agreement or at such other address that a party may hereafter give to the other in writing, it being understood that the notice shall be given to an officer of the other party. Notwithstanding the termination of this Agreement by either party, all provisions of this Agreement relating to the rights and obligations concerning Confidential Information disclosed prior to the effective date of termination of this Agreement shall continue for a period of five (5) years from the date of disclosure of the Confidential Information or for the maximum period provided under applicable law.</p>
 
<p>10. Expenses and Compliance with Laws – Each party shall bear its own expenses in relation to this Agreement. Each party will comply with all applicable laws (including the Export Administration Act), rules, and regulations of competent public authorities relating to its performance of this Agreement.  The obligations of this Section as to the Export Administration Act shall survive any expiration or termination of this Agreement.”</p>
                                                                                                  
<p>11. Miscellaneous – This Agreement shall be governed and construed by the laws of the state of California without reference to the choice of law principles thereof and shall be binding upon the parties and their respective successors and assigns.  Neither party shall assign this Agreement without the other party’s prior written consent. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties and supersedes all prior negotiations and communications, written or oral, between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof.  Any amendment or modification of this Agreement shall be in writing and executed by duly authorized representatives of the parties.  The failure or neglect by Disclosing Party to enforce at any time any of the provisions of this Agreement shall not be construed or deemed to be a waiver of Disclosing Party’s rights hereunder nor shall it prejudice Disclosing Party’s rights to take subsequent action.  This Agreement may be executed in counterparts and by facsimile, each of which shall be deemed an original, but both of which taken together shall constitute one and the same instrument.</p> -->
